# Microwave
A very useful, practical project. Built as a CSS/HTML Audio practice project. This was an 
early example of my Javascript code, so there are a few errors/inefficiencies in the project. However, everything still
functions as expected.

Things I could have improved:
1. Instead of having a main function with arguments, I split it up into 10 different functions for each button... lots of code!
2. I could have re-designed the numbers to be a bit easier to use. 
3. The CSS is not responsive.
